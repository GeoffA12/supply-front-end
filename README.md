## What to Expect ##
This repository will compose of mostly unique frontend components to our supply side clients. Things such as the HTML pages, 
style sheets and JavaScript can be found here. 

## Feature Set ##
A fleet manager will be able to log into their WeGo accounts and have access to all of their fleets, its
vehicles, and several ways to interact with them, such as:

* Adding 

* Removing

* Updating

vehicles from any of their desired fleets without having to navigate off the landing page. In addition, 
a fleet manager will be displayed with both a map of his vehicles and a bulletin board which will present
them with urgent actions that must be taken or potential issues that may arise.
