## What to Expect
This repository will compose of mostly unique frontend components to our supply side clients. Things such as the HTML pages, 
style sheets and JavaScript can be found here. 

## Feature Set
A fleet manager will be able to log into their WeGo accounts and have access to all of their fleets, its
vehicles, and several ways to interact with them, such as:

* Adding 

* Removing

* Updating

vehicles from any of their desired fleets without having to navigate off the landing page. In addition, 
a fleet manager will be displayed with both a map of his vehicles and a bulletin board which will present
them with urgent actions that must be taken or potential issues that may arise.
